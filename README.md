Frontend for SportsLeague MySQL Database

A frontend for interacting with the SportsLeague MySQL database. This program allows the user to query, insert, update, or delete items in the database. Protections are in place to prevent malicious actions.

Requirements

- MySQL server running locally.
- MySQL JDBC connector (version 9.1.0 provided in the `jdbc` folder).

Steps to Run the Frontend

1. Compile and Run:
   - In the terminal, compile and run the frontend using:
     bash
     java -cp <path/to/jdbc>/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar;. SQLFrontend
     Replace `<path/to/jdbc>` with the actual path to the `jdbc` folder.

2. Features:
   - Query data: Retrieve game or team information.
   - Insert data: Add new records to the database.
   - Update data: Modify existing data (e.g., update a teamâ€™s win count).
   - Delete data: Remove specific records from the database.

Example Usage

SQL Queries
Retrieve All Employees with Salaries Above $30 Million:
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Salary > 30000000;

Insert a New Game:
INSERT INTO game (HomeTeam, AwayTeam, Date, Location, Score, Sport) 
VALUES ('Dallas Cowboys', 'Miami Dolphins', '2024-12-01', 'AT&T Stadium', '21-17', 'NFL');

Update Game Score:
UPDATE game 
SET Score = '35-21' 
WHERE HomeTeam = 'Dallas Cowboys' AND AwayTeam = 'Miami Dolphins' AND Date = '2024-12-01';

Delete a Team:
DELETE FROM team WHERE TeamName = 'Test Team';

Notes

- Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible locally before starting.

Enjoy managing your Sports League database!
