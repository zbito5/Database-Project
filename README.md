create_tables.sql
This script creates the necessary tables for the SportsLeague database, including:

game: Stores information about each game, including the home team, away team, date, location, score, and sport.
Example of the game table:

CREATE TABLE game (

    HomeTeam VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    
    AwayTeam VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    
    Date DATE NOT NULL,
    
    Location VARCHAR(100),
    
    Score VARCHAR(20),
    
    Sport VARCHAR(10),
    
    PRIMARY KEY (HomeTeam, AwayTeam, Date)
);
insert_data.sql

This script contains SQL insert statements to populate the database with sample sports game data.

Example:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO game (HomeTeam, AwayTeam, Date, Location, Score, Sport)
VALUES ('Pittsburgh Penguins', 'Nashville Predators', '2024-04-15', 'Pittsburgh Penguins Arena', '2-2', 'NHL');

sport_league_queries.sql

Has sample queries to run in the database

*****Frontend for Sports Leauge MySQL Database

A basic frontend for the Sports MySQL database. This program allows the user to query about, insert into, update, or delete items from the table. There are some protections to prevent malicious actions to the table. This program also requires a local database to be running on the system.

NOTES:
	- This program requires using the JDBC MySQL connector. Version 9.1.0 is provided in the folder named "jdbc".
	- To run the program, in the terminal, run the java file with:
	java -cp <path/to/jdbc>/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar;. SQLFrontend
	...where <path/to/jdbc>/ is wherever the JDBC connector is.
