    Location VARCHAR(100),
    
    Score VARCHAR(20),
    
    Sport VARCHAR(10),
    
    PRIMARY KEY (HomeTeam, AwayTeam, Date)
);

Copy code
INSERT INTO game (HomeTeam, AwayTeam, Date, Location, Score, Sport)
VALUES ('Pittsburgh Penguins', 'Nashville Predators', '2024-04-15', 'Pittsburgh Penguins Arena', '2-2', 'NHL');
queries.sql
This file contains queries to interact with the data. Use these queries to retrieve game information, such as tied games, games by date, and more.
